Create a fun, interactive single-page website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Theme:
This is my "First Website" made for my sister.

Requirements:

1. When the website opens, there should be a cute animated banner at the top that looks like it is hanging with ropes.
   The banner text should say:
   "🎉 MY FIRST WEBSITE 🎉"

2. Below the banner, display a big question:
   "Do you think this website is good?"

3. Show two big buttons:
   - A green button that says "GOOD 💚"
   - A red button that says "BAD 😈"

4. Here is the twist:
   - When the user tries to click the "BAD" button:
        • The BAD button should move away from the cursor randomly.
        • The GOOD button should increase in size each time BAD is attempted.
        • Add a funny message like:
          "Nice try 😂 You have only one correct option!"
   - This should keep happening until she clicks GOOD.

5. When the GOOD button is clicked:
   - Trigger confetti animation.
   - Show a big glowing message:
     "I KNEW YOU WOULD CHOOSE GOOD 😎💖"
   - Play a small celebration sound (optional).
   - Change background to a colorful gradient.

6. Make the design:
   - Cute
   - Slightly dramatic
   - Smooth animations
   - Mobile responsive
   - Fun fonts

7. Add smooth transitions and playful effects.
8. Use only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).
9. Keep everything in one single HTML file.
